## Unhandled Error in Express Route Handler

This repository demonstrates an example of a common but easily overlooked error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling within route handlers.

The `bug.js` file shows a route handler that attempts to access user data using an ID from the request parameters.  However, it lacks any error handling for cases where the user ID is invalid or not found, which might lead to unexpected behavior or application crashes.

The `bugSolution.js` demonstrates a solution using proper error handling (try...catch block) to manage potential exceptions gracefully, preventing crashes and improving the overall robustness of the application.
